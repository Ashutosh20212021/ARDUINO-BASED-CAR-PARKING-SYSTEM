# ARDUINO-BASED-CAR-PARKING-SYSTEM
This project showcases a car park system using Arduino, IR sensors, a servo motor, and an LCD. It detects vehicles, controls gate operations, displays slot availability, and prevents entry when full. Parking lights are automated using an LDR sensor. It requires skills in analog electronics, network analysis, and Arduino programming.
