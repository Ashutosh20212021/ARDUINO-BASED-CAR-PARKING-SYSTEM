# ARDUINO-BASED-CAR-PARKING-SYSTEM

Working : This smart parking system uses Arduino, IR sensors, a servo motor, and an LCD display. It detects vehicle entry/exit, shows available parking slots, and controls gate operations. The system automatically manages parking lights using an LDR, turning them on at night when external light is low.

Prerequisites : This project involves the background knowledge of Analog electronics, Network analysis and knowledge of Arduino which is an open source software consisting of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.
